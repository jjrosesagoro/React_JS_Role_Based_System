**React JS Role Based System**
<br>
<br>
**Fully implemented prototype that serves as a secure web-enabled role-based system for collecting ideas for 
improvement from staff at the University of Greenwich**
<br>
<br>
The following functionalities have all been implemented:
<br>
<br>
• The University has a Quality Assurance Manager to oversee the process.
<br>
• All Departments have a QA coordinator who is responsible for managing the process
for their Department, and for encouraging staff to contribute.
<br>
• All staff (academic and support) have the opportunity to submit one or more ideas.
<br>
• All staff must agree to Terms and Conditions before they can submit.
<br>
• All staff can optionally upload documents to support their ideas.
<br>
• All ideas can be categorised (tagged) from a list of categories at the point when they 
are submitted.
<br>
• The QA Manager can add additional categories at any time, and can delete categories, 
but only if they have not been used.
<br>
• All staff can see all submitted ideas and can comment on any idea. They can also 
give the Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down for any idea, but only once for any idea.
<br>
• Ideas and comments can be posted anonymously, although the author’s details will be 
stored in the database so any inappropriate ideas can be investigated.
<br>
• All new ideas are disabled after a closure date for new ideas, but comments can 
continue to be done until a final closure date.
<br>
• Once an idea is submitted the system emails a notification to the Department’s QA
Coordinator.
<br>
• The author of an idea receives an automatic email notification whenever a comment is 
submitted to any of their ideas.
<br>
• Lists of Most Popular Ideas (+1 for Thumbs Up, -1 for Thumbs Down), Most Viewed 
Ideas, Latest Ideas and Latest Comments must be made available to all users.
<br>
• The University QA Manager needs to be able to download all the data after the final 
closure date in a CSV file for transfer out of the system. Any uploaded documents 
need to be downloaded in a ZIP file.
<br>
• An administrator is needed to maintain any system data, e.g. closure dates for each 
academic year, staff details.
<br>
• Statistical analysis (e.g. number of ideas per Department) needs to be available.
<br>
• The interface must be suitable for all devices (eg mobile phones, tablets, desktops).
